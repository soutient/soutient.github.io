Research project: Ring‑like structures, operations and equations without explicit quantifiers:
An algebraic theory is specified by a signature — a set of operation symbols with fixed arities, such
as a constant Oₚ, a constant 1ₚ, a unary operation —, and two binary operations + and − acting on
a single carrier. Terms are built inductively from variables and these operations; every application
of an operation to existing terms yields a new term. The axioms of the theory are equations t₁ = t₂
between such terms, with no explicit quantifiers; uni-quantification over the variables is understood.
