• Did you know: The best explanation I've heard is something like this: "In 1940, Turing was puzzled by the 
                cracking of the Nazi Enigma cipher. He cleverly guessed the cipher error. A letter of the Latin 
                alphabet used in the encoding - cannot be itself when pressed. This property in Haskell is 
                designated as the famous "return" in the monad, that is, the encoding must be without "return" to 
                itself! The Germans implemented "return". Turing understood this, and the decoding method was 
                based on successive elimination of letter by letter." Now let's get back to the answer to the 
                question. A monad is what Turing used long before monads were officially invented, without 
                knowing anything about them! Appreciate his talent! Nowadays, this topic is controversial, 
                probably because of the "ban on hacking". But I have never heard a simpler and more precise 
                explanation of the essence of monads.

+Research project: Ring‑like structures, operations and equations without explicit quantifiers:
An algebraic theory is specified by a signature — a set of operation symbols with fixed arities, such
as a constant Oₚ, a constant 1ₚ, a unary operation —, and two binary operations + and − acting on
a single carrier. Terms are built inductively from variables and these operations; every application
of an operation to existing terms yields a new term. The axioms of the theory are equations t₁ = t₂
between such terms, with no explicit quantifiers; uni-quantification over the variables is understood.
